# CS-499 Capstone

## Professional Self- Assessment

#### Strengths

Throughout my tenure at SNHU, I have learned various programming languages and their structures. My first encounter with programming started there. I am able to recognize my strengths by being able to write programs based on the requirements. These programs are simple programs that enables me to learn and grow. One of my greatest takeaways from my experience with the coursework is time management. There were times that I felt that I would not get my modules completed on time. With the help of my advisor, I was able to complete my projects. My journey involved learning how to conduct research, write good papers with proper formatting, and getting help from others or online when I get stuck. These strengths have prepared me for my Capstone by grooming my skills for perseverance. While the Capstone was on artifacts from past courses, the concept of performing enhancements was challenging and rewarding. This ePortfolio is a culmination of all that I have learned along with the skills of management and teamwork.

#### Weaknesses

The weakness that I have most often is trying to solve all the problems myself. I love to help others, but I tend to no ask for help until I am really stuck. It is good to exhaust your options for solving problems, but it also takes a lot of time where you get nowhere when you could ask for help earlier to save time and hone your projects. Another weakness is staying up late to solve issues and getting burned out. 
The  fact that I have spoken about these weaknesses has made me realize that I can become better at handling my weaknesses by keeping it my mind and working to resolve it.

#### Core Values

Values that I have learned throughout my life is to be honest, giving, and love as you do yourself. These traits do not only apply to people, but also to yourself in the professional world. In my courses, we have been taught about being honest when it comes to the work of others and give credit when it is due. One thing I have learned is that honesty will always give you and edge no matter how difficult the task at hand.
Accomplishments
My greatest accomplishment is getting my Bachelorâ€™s degree. This lies on the back of my other achievements that I got while pursuing this degree. I feel good that I can take a piece of legacy code and reverse engineer it to get a working application. This was taught in my CS-410 class. Another accomplishment is with OpenGL. OpenGL was a challenge when I started to learn the concept of creating 2D and 3D graphics. I have gained the skills to use triangles and lighting to accomplish the scene that I want. 
Other accomplishments include skills that I have acquired in scanning networks for vulnerabilities. Some of these tools are Nmap, Zenmap, Snort, OpenVas, and Wireshark. Another skill that I have acquired is knowing how to create an application that uses Maven Dependency to check and find solutions to fix vulnerabilities that exist in the code that I am writing.

#### Goals

My goal is to be one of the best cyber security professionals. That does not mean I will not pursue more knowledge in coding or network security. I believe that knowing more about networks and being good in coding will give me an edge in cyber security. I hope to be employed as an aspiring security specialist that can help to secure the cyber environment and make people lives better.

#### Collaborating in a Team Environment

Collaborating in a team environment gives people working together an opportunity to produce their best work. When collaborating in a team environment, a person must not judge and pass blame to another person but speak to that person on the side to not alienate them. If a person cannot be spoken to, the concern should be voiced to a supervisor in confidence. In my environment, I would always be the person that would keep the members calm and work toward an agreement that benefits all. If this is not done, the project will fall behind resulting in monetary loss and time.

#### Communicating to Stakeholders

Throughout the lifecycle of the project and before, it is imperative that a good working relationship with all stakeholders is established. This dialogue paves the way for understanding exactly what the customers want and who is responsible for certain tasks in the project. The communication also gives the stakeholders and idea of your commitment to the project. Another aspect of good communication is that everyone is kept up to date of the advances, roadblocks, and stages of the project in approaching deadlines and projected costs.

#### Data Structures and Algorithms

Data structures allows for data to be interacted with. Data is organized in the form of linked lists, maps hashed tables, sets, and search trees. Throughout my studies, I have created arrays that hold dictionaries and lists where the data can be looked up using or interacted with using algorithms such as sort, search, insert, update, and delete. Learning data structures and algorithms has helped me to understand how websites are developed and the coding involved to create them.

#### Software Engineering

Software Engineering includes all the aspects related to creating an application. These include the concepts, designs, and principles of the software. The concept behind how the program is to function and what it does shapes the way it is structured. Creating software entails what data structures that will be used, how security is to be applied, and tools that help to produce high quality applications. The concept of software engineering encompasses the requirement specification, implementation, integration, testing, and deployment. This can be looked at as part of the software lifecycle.

#### Databases

A database is an organized collection of data that multiple people can access at the same time and  perform queries or operations like create, read, update, and delete files.  These queries and operations can be accessed securely by creating users and passwords. There are other security measures that can be implemented to secure the database. Entries in a database are entered with keys and values that provide the mechanism for performing queries on the data. The two most used types of databases are SQL and NoSQL. Even though SQL used to be dominant, NoSQL handles big data better and is the choice of many developers.

#### Summarize/Introduce Artifact

The artifact that was chosen is one that signifies and implements the categories of software engineering, data structures and algorithms, and databases. This application is a web interface that is designed to allow a user to see data based on the choice they make. The security of the application is done by providing a salt for the password and using a secure ssl interface connection to connect to the database. The data structures used are  a bar chart, a table, and a map that allows for displaying data based on the algorithm of sorting the data by a choice of either mountain rescue, water rescue, or disaster rescue. This application uses the schemaless database MongoDB that contains the data that the queries are ran on.
